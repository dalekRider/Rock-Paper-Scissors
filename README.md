# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Simple Roshambo JavaScript 

This is another project created following the <a href="www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">CodeCademy </a> JavaScript course. I have included the solution file and another version which I have tweaked. 

I did add an additional condition on the solution to prevent it from returning console.logs for the user/computer choices when the user provided an option not acceptable. Before the tweak if someone input say.. bazooka, it would return the following in console:

Invalid Choice: Please choose rock, paper or scissors.
You have chosen <strong>undefined</strong> to represent humanity!
The machines have selected <strong>rock</strong> as their champion!

Now if an incorrect input is used it gives an invalid choice message and then asks the user to try again and leaves out those last two messages which will only be triggered if the correct choices are used. 

The second version uses prompts and alerts like some of the other functions I have posted recently. I plan to update these when I can to make them more interactive. For now the focus is on creating muscle memory for core JavaScript. Then moving to DOM manipulation for each one of these. After that maybe making them a bit more fun with some slick CSS and animations. 

Enjoy and please check back again
